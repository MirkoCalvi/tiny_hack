## üé® **Project: MuseINO ‚Äî Smart Museum Vision System**

### üîç **General Concept**

Install an **Arduino Nicla Vision** on the **lower frame of a painting or artwork** to create an **intelligent surveillance and visitor behavioral analysis system**.

### üéØ **Main Objectives**

1. **Surveillance and security:**
   * Use the **depth sensor (ToF)** to measure visitors' distance from the painting.
   * Establish a **safety distance** as a "baseline" and generate an **alert** if someone gets too close.
   * Detect and **count people** in the area of interest, to analyse flows and plan accordingly.

2. **Visitor statistical analysis:**
   * Recognize **how many people actually look at the painting**, not just how many pass in front of it.
   * Estimate **average dwell time** for each visitor.
   * Use a **classification or detection model (Focoos AI)** to differentiate between "passersby" and "observers".

3. **Future extensions:**
   * Application in **stores or supermarkets** for behavioral analysis and "shopping analytics".
   * Totems in **shopping malls** for heatmaps and interaction data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### üß† **1. On-edge Processing (Nicla Vision)**

The Nicla Vision (dual-core STM32H747, 2MP camera, integrated ToF sensor and IMU):

* Captures frames from the **camera** and **ToF sensor**.
* Executes **object detection or classification** locally.
* Sends **synthetic data** (position, distance, object ID) via **WiFi or BLE** to the server.
* In case of anomaly (e.g., too close to the painting), can also transmit **the image**.

### üíª **2. Server (PC or Python mini-server)**

* Receives data via **WiFi/IP**.
* Performs **post-processing**:
  * Tracking people over time.
  * Calculating average dwell time.
  * Generating **heatmaps** for position and viewing direction.
* Web dashboard: displays number of visitors, average duration, most observed areas.
* (Roadmap feature) **Database** for historical analysis or real-time dashboard.

### üîÅ **3. Communication and Synchronization**

* Nicla ‚Üí Server via **WiFi (ESP32/Murata 1DX)** or **BLE**.
* Lightweight protocol (e.g., MQTT or Python socket).
* Optional alert module (buzzer or LED) managed by Arduino.

## üß© **AI Pipeline**

### üì∏ **Computer Vision Model Sketch (on-edge)**

1. **Dataset collection**
   * Acquiring images of people in front of the painting, various distances and poses.

2. **Preprocessing and data augmentation**
   * Cropping, resizing, rotation, lighting variations.

3. **Model training** on **Focoos AI** intuitive platform (finetuning of `fai-cls-n-coco`).

4. **Testing and validation**

5. **Quantization** and **compilation**
   * Converting using ONNX the model to **optimized format (C++ static library)**.

6. **Deploy on Nicla Vision** via **Zant** and **Zig compiler**.
