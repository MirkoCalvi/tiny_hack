# Performance & Deployment Considerations

## Real-time Performance

The model's performance on actual hardware is critical for user experience. Our system on the Nicla Vision provides rapid feedback to users as they approach the correct bin. This real-time responsiveness is essential for maintaining user engagement and ensuring accurate waste sorting.

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Inference Time**: <100ms per classification
- **Frame Rate**: 2 FPS continuous operation
- **Latency**: Minimal delay between object detection and bin recommendation
- **Power Efficiency**: Optimized for extended battery operation

## Hybrid Computing Architecture

### Edge-First Approach
While the primary classification happens on-device for speed, we implement a **hybrid computing strategy** where:

- **Edge Processing**: Real-time classification on Nicla Vision
- **Cloud Processing**: Post-processing and model improvement
- **Data Pipeline**: Secure transmission of real data

### Continuous Learning Pipeline
We plan to implement a **teacher-student learning system**:

1. **Data Collection**: Images are transmitted via WiFi to a server
2. **Offline Training**: Larger models are retrained with real-world data
3. **Knowledge Distillation**: Improved models teach the edge model device
4. **Model Updates**: Periodic deployment of enhanced models

This approach enables:
- **Continuous improvement** with real user data
- **Better performance** on edge cases
- **Adaptation** to local waste patterns
- **Privacy preservation** through data anonymization

This comprehensive approach ensures the system is not just technically functional, but also user-friendly, maintainable, and continuously improving.
