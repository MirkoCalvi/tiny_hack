# **MoodSip – Project Specifications**

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Purpose

MoodSip is an **intelligent hydration assistant** designed to encourage optimal water intake through emotion-aware interactions.
It leverages the **Arduino Nicla Vision** board to combine computer vision, environmental sensing, motion detection, and ambient temperature monitoring.
Using AI-based emotion recognition, it provides **proactive hydration reminders** based on the user’s psychological and physiological state.

### 1.2 Main Objectives

* Monitor the user’s presence and emotional state in real time.
* Suggest optimal hydration moments based on environmental and emotional data.
* Detect when the user lifts or tilts the bottle to confirm a drinking action.
* Adjust reminder frequency based on mood and stress indicators.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Usage Context

The user places the bottle on a desk during work.
The system initializes an **internal hydration timer**, which accounts for:

* ambient temperature;
* duration since the last drinking action.

When the timer expires, the **blue onboard LED** on Nicla Vision flashes to prompt hydration.
If MoodSip detects negative emotions (e.g., stress, sadness, fatigue), the timer interval is **shortened dynamically** to encourage earlier water intake.

### 2.2 Drinking Action Detection

The onboard accelerometer detects **lifting and tilting motions**, confirming that the user has drunk from the bottle.
Detection resets the hydration timer.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Overview

The architecture integrates both **edge** and **cloud** AI components for balanced efficiency:

1. **Onboard Processing** – Conducted locally on the Arduino Nicla Vision using optimized, quantized vision models.
2. **Cloud Processing (Companion App + Remote AI)** – High-performance emotional analysis handled remotely through BLE connectivity.

| **2. Emotional Analysis (Cloud)** | When paired with the Companion App, a cloud-based AI model (Gemini 2.5 Flash) performs deeper analysis of facial expressions to assess emotional states and determine if an early hydration reminder is required. | **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, **BLE** |
